# Important

Make sure to add the _travelers backpack_ mod to the curseforge profile **manually**. It was a custom updated mod so it is **not** in curseforge's database. 

This is a simple process. Clicking on the three vertical dots in the curseforge profile next to the "play" button, clicking "open folder" and navigating to the "mods" folder and adding the jar file to the folder.
